Question 1
Subsidiary A uploads confidential documents.
Subsidiary B is in a contract with A, so some discussion overlaps.
Subsidiary A sends a chat message asking for general information about Subsidiary B — not requesting access to confidential documents, but asking contextual info like:
"Hey, who is the signatory on this contract?" or
"Can you confirm the policy number associated with this deal?"
What kind of chat interaction is allowed or appropriate in this scenario?

Answer
In this situation, the chat interaction is generally okay as long as:

No confidential or sensitive information is being shared.

The people chatting are both authorized to talk about the deal.

The information being asked (like signatory name or policy number) is not restricted or private under company policy.

Since Subsidiary A and B are already in a contract together, asking general questions like "Who signed the contract?" or "What’s the policy number?" is usually fine, if it's just for context and not for accessing protected documents.

However, to be safe:

If there’s any doubt about whether the info is sensitive, it’s better to use formal channels like an internal request system or ask Legal/Compliance.

All employees should follow the company's data sharing and communication policies.

As a QA Lead, I would also make sure these types of cases are considered in our test scenarios and ensure teams are trained on what’s okay to share and what’s not.

In short:
👉 The chat is appropriate if it’s general info, not sensitive, and shared by the right people.
👉 If unsure, use formal processes or check with compliance.

🔍 Follow-up Scenario-Based Questions
What if Subsidiary A accidentally receives a document that includes confidential data from Subsidiary B?

How should they handle it? What is the QA or tester’s role in preventing such leaks?

How would you test that only the right users can see or request certain information across subsidiaries?

(This checks their knowledge of authorization, role-based access control, and boundary testing.)

How do you test chat or collaboration tools for compliance and security?

For example, if your application has built-in messaging — how would you test that messages don’t leak sensitive info?

What kind of negative test cases would you write for this situation?

E.g., What happens if an unauthorized user tries to request or view contract data?

How would you report a situation where someone shares more than they should in a chat?

Looking for soft skills and understanding of escalation protocols.

If you see a gray area where you’re unsure if something is sensitive — what’s your approach?

🧠 Knowledge & Best Practice Questions
What’s the difference between confidential and contextual information? Can you give examples of each?

What are some QA test strategies to make sure data segregation between subsidiaries is enforced?

Have you worked with any compliance frameworks like GDPR, SOC2, or HIPAA? How did they impact your testing?

How do you collaborate with Legal, Security, or Privacy teams during test planning or bug triaging?
